In the GitHub Portfolio Project Iâ€™ll create a personal website to highlight your experience and code projects. 
As part of your portfolio, you will highlight three coding projects that you encounter in this course:

* Week 7: PacMen Exercise
* Week 8: Eye Exercise
* Week 9: Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise

You may review this module for videos, instructions, and rubrics on what you should include in your portfolio,
what you will be evaluated on, and how to upload the links to your portfolio for grading.
